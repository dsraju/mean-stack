Todo task list app based on the MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) stack
You can add todo tasks to the list. When the cursor hovers on the 'del' button,
it displays the message created date-time. Click the button to delete the message.

Why is this 'todo task app' when million apps/web sites already available.
This app can be used as a reference to develop many similar mean-stack apps,
that may save some time.
