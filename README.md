Todo task list web app is based on the MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) stack
using REST API.
You can add todo tasks to the list. The list is saved in mongodb.
When the cursor hovers over the 'del' button, it displays the message with the
created date-time. Click the button to delete the message.

Why is this 'todo task app' when million apps/web sites already available with different stacks or native api.
This app can be used as a reference to develop many similar mean-stack based apps with REST API that might save some time.
